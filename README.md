ShapeCrawler (formerly SlideDotNet) is a .NET library for manipulating PowerPoint presentations. It provides fluent APIs to process slides without having Microsoft Office installed.

This library provides a simplified object model on top of the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) for manipulating PowerPoint documents.

The project is in development, and Iâ€™m pretty sure there are still lots of things to add in this library. Try it out and let me know your thoughts. Feel free to submit a ticket if you find bugs. Your valuable feedback is much appreciated to improve this project better.
